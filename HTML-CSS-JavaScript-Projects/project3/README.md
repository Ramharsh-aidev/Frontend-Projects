# Getting Started with Project

**Deciding UI of Website:** <br>
For our website's UI design, we have chosen to reference Quizlet's main page. We are particularly focusing on their navigation structure and overall layout to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience. This includes elements like the top navigation bar, the sidebar, and the main content area. Our goal is to adapt these elements to fit the unique needs of our project while maintaining a clean and effective interface.

**Convention while writing a code:** <br>
**[1]** All code has to be lowercase: This applies to HTML element names, attributes, attribute values, CSS selectors, properties, and property values (with the exception of strings).
<br> <br>
_Not recommended_
<br>
&lt;A HREF="/"&gt;Home;/a&gt;
<br>
_Recommended_
<br>
&lt;a href="/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
<br>

**[2]** Naming Convention: <br>
folder name => Snake case(hello_world) <br>
file name => Pascal case (HelloWorld) <br>
id => Camel case (helloWorld) <br>
class => Kabab case (hello-world) <br>

Use meaningful names for id and classes

**[3]** Separate rules by new lines, i.e. always put a blank line (two line breaks) between rules. <br>
eg.

html { <br>
background: #fff; <br>
}
<br>
<br>
body { <br>
margin: auto;
width: 50%; <br>
}
